# `d3-symap`

⛔️ DEPRECATED/NO LONGER MAINTAINED ⛔️

Project from a decade ago reproducing Symap overprinting for choropleth mapping, as well as an implementation of the inverse distance weighting algorithm for interpolation and contouring.

As of April 2025, considering rewriting/packaging the parts of it that aren't obviously duplicated elsewhere, though not until June 2025 at the earliest.
